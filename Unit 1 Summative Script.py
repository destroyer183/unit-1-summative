# [BEEP BEEP BEEP] you hear. it's 8am, and the sound of your alarm clock has woken you up on monday for school. you get up, get dressed and cleaned up, 
# and then you eat and get on the bus to go to school. after you get to school and get to math class, you realize that you forgot to do your homework, 
# as you played video games all weekend. you know that your teacher and parents hate it when homework isn't done, and as the teacher is coming around checking homework,
# you start panicking, as you don't know what to do, and now you must make a choice. Do you:
# A: tell the teacher your dog ate your homework (liar type)
